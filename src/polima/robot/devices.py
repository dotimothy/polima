"""Finding the arm and the cameras, and saying so when they are not there.

Every legacy launcher takes `--robot-port`, `--perspective-camera` and
`--wrist-camera` as required arguments, so getting a robot running starts with
`ls /dev/v4l/by-id` and reading USB ids. This does that lookup instead.

## Why by-id paths, never /dev/video0

`/dev/videoN` is assigned in enumeration order, so unplugging a camera or
rebooting can swap the two. Both cameras then still open, the policy still runs,
and the arm reaches for the wrong place -- there is no error anywhere. The
`/dev/v4l/by-id/` names are stable per physical device, which is why both legacy
launchers pass those and why this refuses to guess a bare index.

Depends on stdlib only: it runs on the board, in the `lerobot` venv, and on a
host with no hardware at all.
