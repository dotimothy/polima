"""Pull normalization statistics out of a LeRobot checkpoint.

Normalization is host-owned in every SiMa deployment here: the MLA graphs take
already-normalized tensors and return normalized actions, and the board's C++
does the mean/std arithmetic. So these numbers have to travel with the bundle,
and they have to come from the checkpoint rather than the dataset -- a policy
trained on one normalization and served with another is silently wrong, not
broken, which is the worst failure mode available.

LeRobot stores them indirectly. `policy_preprocessor.json` lists processor steps;
the one named `normalizer_processor` names a safetensors file, and that file
holds `<feature>.mean` / `<feature>.std`. The unnormalizer for actions is the
mirror image in `policy_postprocessor.json`. Following that indirection is the
whole job, and it is identical for ACT, SmolVLA and GR00T -- which is why this
lives in `export/` rather than under a policy.
