"""Locating and invoking the SiMa model-compiler venv.

The compiler is a separate interpreter from everything else PoLiMa runs in: it
has `afe`, `onnx` and `onnxsim` but no torch, while the training env has torch
but no afe. Neither can import the other's modules, so the compile stage is
always a subprocess, never an import.

`polima doctor` and `polima compile` need the same discovery, so it lives here
rather than in either.
