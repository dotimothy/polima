"""Calibration sample construction, unified across the three legacy variants.

This is the part of `sima_compile_onnx_tensors.py` that actually differs between
ACT, SmolVLA and GR00T, and the part most likely to be silently wrong: a bad
calibration set does not raise, it just produces a quantized model whose outputs
drift. So it lives here, depends on numpy only, and is covered by unit tests.

The three sources are a union, not a choice of one:

  npz      ACT and GR00T -- one array per model input, leading axis = sample.
  raw_f32  SmolVLA -- a flat .f32 file for a single-input graph, samples
           concatenated. Used where the calibration data is an activation
           captured from a previous stage rather than a dataset sample.
  random   the fallback when no data is supplied.

## The layout rule

`ImporterParams(layout=...)` tells afe how to read the *model*. It does not
describe the calibration data: afe's quantizer wants NHWC regardless, which is
why the curated `quantize_compile` helper transposes unconditionally. That
unconditional transpose is exactly what SmolVLA had to work around, because it
corrupts rank-2/rank-3 action-side tensors that have no spatial axes at all.

The correct rule, and the one all three legacy copies converge on once you line
them up, is narrower: transpose only a rank-4 tensor, and only when the model is
NCHW. Everything else passes through untouched. It is applied uniformly to all
three sources here so the source cannot change the meaning of the layout flag.
