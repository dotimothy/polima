"""Find and unpack SiMa model packs (`*_mpk.tar.gz`).

Replaces `SmolVLA/scripts/unpack_sima_mpk.py`, which GR00T also depends on.

An mpk is the compiler's shippable artifact: a gzipped tar holding the MLA ELF,
its `.so` helpers, and json config that points at both by whatever path the
compile host happened to use. Unpacking is therefore not just extraction -- the
json has to be rewritten to the new location or the runtime looks for the model
where the build machine kept it.

The layout produced (`etc/`, `lib/`, `share/`) is what the on-device loader
expects, and matches `models_uncompressed/<graph>/` in the legacy build trees.
