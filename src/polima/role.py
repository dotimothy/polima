"""Which half of PoLiMa is installed here.

PoLiMa spans two machines with incompatible dependency sets:

    HOST  (x86_64 workstation / VM)      BOARD (Modalix SoM, aarch64)
    ------------------------------      ----------------------------
    build it                            run it
    polima-compile  export (torch)      polima-run     serve the policy
                    + compile (afe),    polima robot   drive the arm
                    two separate venvs                 (lerobot venv)
    polima-deploy   ssh, rsync

The host builds; the board runs. Nothing on the host drives a robot and nothing
on the board compiles. The robot client sits with the server because it sends
two 640x480 frames per control step -- ~110 MB/s at 30 Hz -- which should be a
loopback copy, not a network hop.

PoLiMa does not train. Training stays with `lerobot-train` in the model stacks;
PoLiMa picks up at the checkpoint.

Both halves share one core -- policy specs, wire protocol, bundle layout, config
-- because that core *is* the contract between them: the host writes bundle.json
and plan.json, the board reads them. The core therefore imports with stdlib +
numpy alone, and `polima doctor` proves it in every interpreter.

This module reports what the local install can actually do, so a command that
cannot work here says so plainly instead of dying on an ImportError three frames
deep in a vendored library.
