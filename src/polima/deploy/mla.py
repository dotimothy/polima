"""Modalix accelerator recovery.

Loading a model can fail even though the ELF is perfect and the board is
otherwise healthy. The MLA allocates from a reserved CMA pool, and a process
that is SIGKILLed -- which is exactly what `service.stop` escalates to when a
server ignores SIGTERM -- never releases its DMA-coherent buffers. Cycle a few
1.3 GB bundles that way and the pool is free but fragmented::

    CmaTotal:  1830912 kB
    CmaFree:   1031888 kB      <- a gigabyte free ...
    simaai-memory simaai,dms0-manager: dma_alloc_coherent alloc of 67108864 bytes failed
                                      <- ... that cannot serve 64 MB contiguous

The driver reports that as ``MLA_LOAD_FAILED errCode=1001``, which reads like a
corrupt ELF. It is not: the same bundle loaded fine an hour earlier. Only the
`dmesg` line names the real cause, so a deploy that just retries the load, or a
human reading the error, both draw the wrong conclusion.

The ladder below is taken from neat-genai-studio's ``run.sh``
(``reset_mla_dispatcher``), which resets the dispatcher on every launch and
again whenever a load fails. The ordering matters and is not obvious:
``fix_devkit_runtime.sh`` re-inits the MLA memory pool via
``mla_init_modalix.elf`` *before* restarting the services, and it is that step,
not the service restart, that defragments CMA. Restarting
``simaai-appcomplex.service`` alone leaves the pool exactly as fragmented as it
was found.
