"""GR00T N1.6 -- Eagle VLM + flow-matching DiT, third port into PoLiMa.

Every constant is transcribed from the working GR00T-N1.6 stack, not invented:

  GR00T-N1.6/devkit/groot_full_llima/groot_full_llima.cpp       pipeline, sizes
  GR00T-N1.6/scripts/export_groot_modalix_eagle.py              the Eagle cut
  GR00T-N1.6/scripts/export_groot_modalix_action.py             the action cut
  GR00T-N1.6/scripts/groot_modalix_compile_controller.py        per-graph flags
  GR00T-N1.6/train_groot_local.sh                               fine-tune, cameras
  GR00T-N1.6/config/modality.json                               SO-101 modalities

## How it differs from SmolVLA, structurally

SmolVLA cuts into four graphs. GR00T cuts into forty-five, because neither the
Eagle backbone nor the 32-block DiT fits the compiler in one piece: the VLM is
split into 26 stages and the action head into 19. That is the whole reason this
spec is generated rather than typed out.

Forty-five graphs would also mean forty-five upload/download round trips, which
is what the two `run_elf_chain` steps exist to avoid -- sixteen vision ELFs and
nine language ELFs each run device-resident behind a single transfer. The build
tree's own validation records what that is worth: Eagle fell from 362 ms to
169 ms when the chains landed, taking the full image-to-action pipeline from
652 ms to 457 ms.

## Two horizons, and which one this spec declares

The compiled artifacts in `GR00T-N1.6/outputs/modalix_groot_n1d6_base_gr1/` are
the *base* GR1 checkpoint: 50-step action horizon, embodiment id 20, 128-wide
state and action lanes. `train_groot_local.sh` fine-tunes the same architecture
on the local two-camera SO-101 dataset under `NEW_EMBODIMENT` with a 16-step
horizon (`config/so101_config.py`).

This spec declares the 50-step geometry, because that is the only decomposition
that has been exported, compiled, and measured end to end. A 16-step bundle is
the same graph shapes with `CHUNK = 16`; `runtime.CHUNK` is the single place
that changes, and every dependent size is derived from it.

## Language conditioning

Like SmolVLA, GR00T is language-conditioned, so `single_task` is False. The
prompt embedding is *precomputed* into `constants/prompt_embedding` at export:
the task string is fixed for a deployed checkpoint, and embedding it on every
inference would mean shipping the 151,680-row vocabulary table to the board.
Changing the task means re-exporting.
