// Managing polima_server from inside the interactive session.
//
// The session and the server are separate processes competing for one
// accelerator, so `unload` that frees only the session's models leaves the MLA
// just as occupied as before. To actually release it, the server has to stop --
// polima_server holds its Plan for its whole life by design, since a serving
// process that can drop its model mid-request is worse than one you restart.
//
// Paths match polima/deploy/service.py exactly (var/run/server.pid,
// var/log/server.log, bin/polima_server), because both manage the same process
// and disagreeing about where the pid file lives is how you end up with two
// servers on one port.
